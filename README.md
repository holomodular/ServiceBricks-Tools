This repository is for open source tools related to the ServiceBricks platform.

# ImportApp

ServiceBricks is a powerful framework that lets you create robust, modular microservices with minimal effort. One of its standout features is the ability to generate a microservice from an existing application, saving time and letting you reuse your existing database objects and models. Run the included ImportApp utility to export a JSON file that can be used to import a ServiceBricks microservice.
